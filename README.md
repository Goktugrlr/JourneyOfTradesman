In Journey of Tradesman, you are portraying the daily life of a tradesman. Let's see if your trading skills are up to the challenge!

## Objective

Who knows, maybe the game ends when you purchase a surprise potion, what do you think?  

## Gameplay Features 🎮

Purchase products from customers.

- **Sell Item:** 💸
Sell your items to make a profit.

Be careful; if the price you offer doesn’t attract customers, you might risk losing them.

Track your progress, including profits, losses and the number of items bought and sold. Stay informed to improve your strategy.

Visit the market to purchase special potions that offer boosts and enhance your business.

- **Time:** ⏳
Customers start arriving at 6 AM. By evening at 7 PM, the shop closes. However, if you wish, you can extend the closing time by purchasing a red potion from the shop. 
Additionally, to keep things interesting when there are no customers, time speeds up, but slows down once a customer arrives.

- **Sleep:** 💤
You can start the next day by pressing the sleep button. Remember, this button only becomes active when the shop closes in the evenings.
